Think of your React app as a toolbox that you fill with ready-to-use components 
which can easily get dropped onto your web page. Just like how you put together pieces of a puzzle, you can combine components to create a complete and functional web application.

To start, you'll have an index file that acts as the main starting point of your web application. Inside the index file, you'll render one main component, the App component which is the central part of your web page. It takes up the entire screen and holds all the other components together while keeping them organized.

When you run your React app, React works behind the scenes to calculate the minimum changes required to refresh the page. This is what makes your website fast and responsive.

In the upcoming video we will dive deeper into the index and App components
Specifically, I explain how to:
* Install react app
* Set up Index.js
* Set up App.js
* Nest components
